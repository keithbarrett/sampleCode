# sampleCode
Sample generic code for prospective employers as proof of language proficiency.
They are pieces from profects throughout my career and I am the sole author.
Some of the samples aren't functional standalone, as I may have removed pieces
to stay compliant with NDAs.

*Note all code references to "kgb" or "barrk012" or "kbarret9" mean me.*

"C" is my favorite language, with Java being a close second, and PHP third. I
did PERL for a few years at IBM, Red Hat and Disney, but I'm a bit rusty. Java
components I use include JDBC, Hibernate, and JAXB. In all languages I am pro-
ficient in APIs, RESTful, JSON Parsing, XML.

Computer "Languages" I professionally coded in (**BOLD** indicates a sample
exists in the repository):
- **BASIC (Compiled)** (RSTS/E, VAX/VMS, Amiga, Atari, Visual BASIC)
- **C** (strongest language across all platforms)
- DOS BATCH, PowerShell
- HTML (and some CSS)
- **Java**
- **JSON** Parsing
- PERL
- PHP
- Sh Shell
- SQL (Oracle, MySQL)
- XML, XSL

Additional "Languages" I have beginner or maintenance skills in:
- **Applescript**
- SOAP
- CSS
- Javascript
- Python
- Rexx
- Ruby (on Rails)
- Groovy

Some Development Tools and Frameworks I use:
- gcc, gdb
- Git, CVS
- emacs (preferred editor)
- curl
- cron (crontab)
- Eclipse
- JBOSS
- Android Studio
- XMLSpy
- Maven
- Embarcadero, TOAD, DbVisualizer
- Bugzilla
- oAuth
- TCP/IP Sockets
- Unix Semaphores
- OpenShift and Docker containers
- Message Queuing (Oracle/BEA Tuxedo, MQ)

New "Languages" I hope to pick up:
- Swift
- YAML
- Jenkins File

Legacy Languages I've worked in but are no longer in demand:
- ALGOL
- Assembler (Motorola 68000 series, Intel x86)
- DATATRIEVE
- dBase
- **FORTRAN**
- MACRO-11
- **MACRO-VMS**
- PASCAL
- PL/I
- RNO, Runoff, SDML, man (Documentation languages)
- **VMS DCL** (DEC Command Language)
- VMS RMS (Record Management System)
