# sampleCode
Sample source code for prospective employers from projects throughout my career.
I am the sole author of these samples. Some of the newer smples aren't funtional,
as I may have removed pieces of code to protect the vendor project it was part of.

*Note that all comment references to "kgb" or "barrk012" or "kbarret9" mean me.*

The Java sample is not representitve of my skills, but it was handy when I set
this repository up. I plan to replace it with a better sample. My Java
programming is primarily POJO with API, REST, Hibernate, JDBC and API experience.
