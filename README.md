# sampleCode
Sample source code for prospective employers from projects throughout my career.
I am the sole author of these samples. Some of the newer smples are not funtional,
as I may have removed pieces of code to protect the vendor project it was part of.

Note that all comment references to "kgb" or "barrk012" mean me.

The Java sample is not representitve of my skills, but it was handy when I set
this repository up. I plan to replace it with a better sample.
