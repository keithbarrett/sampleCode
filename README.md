# sampleCode

Sample generic code samples as proof of language proficiency.
These are pieces from projects throughout my career and I am the sole author.
Some of the samples aren't functional standalone because I had to scrub them
to stay compliant with corporate NDAs or IP.

*Note all code references to "kgb", "barrk012", "kbarret9" or "keibarre" mean me.*

"C" and Python are my favorite languages, followed by Java, then PHP. I
did PERL for a few years at IBM, Red Hat and Disney, but I'm a bit rusty. Java
components I use include JDBC, Hibernate, and JAXB. In all languages I am
proficient in APIs, RESTful, JSON, XML.

Computer "Languages" I professionally coded in (**BOLD** indicates a sample
exists in the repository):
- **C** (strongest language across all platforms)
- **Python** (includes JSON, XML, Restful)
- **Java**
- **PHP**
- **Shell / Bash**
- **SQL** (Oracle, MySQL)
- DOS BATCH, PowerShell
- HTML (and some CSS)
- **PERL**

Additional "Languages" I have beginner or maintenance skills in:
- Applescript
- CSS
- Javascript
- Rexx
- Ruby (on Rails)
- YAML, Jenkins File

Some Development Tools and Frameworks I use:
- gcc, gdb
- Git, CVS
- emacs
- curl, w3m
- cron (crontab)
- Eclipse, JBOSS, RAD, Pycharm
- Android Studio
- XMLSpy
- Maven
- Embarcadero, TOAD, DbVisualizer
- Bugzilla
- oAuth
- TCP/IP Sockets
- Unix Semaphores
- OpenShift and Docker containers
- Message Queuing (Oracle/BEA Tuxedo, MQ)

New "Languages" I hope to pick up:
- Swift
- Groovy

Legacy Languages I've worked in but are no longer in demand:
- ALGOL
- Assembler (Motorola 68000 series, Intel x86)
- **BASIC (Compiled)** (RSTS/E, VAX/VMS, Amiga, Atari)
- **DATATRIEVE**
- **dBase**
- **FORTRAN**
- MACRO-11
- **MACRO-VMS**
- PASCAL
- PL/I
- RNO, Runoff, SDML, man, SGML (Documentation languages)
- **VMS DCL** (DEC Command Language)
- VMS RMS (Record Management System)
